"""This is a utility script for developers to read in and write back out the dvc database.
It is useful for standardizing the format of the example dvc data, and also for checking that the database
mostly still works.

To use this script, install openlifu to a python environment and then run the script providing the database folder as an argument:

```
python standardize_database.py db_dvc/
```

A couple of known issues to watch out for:
- The date_modified of Sessions gets updated, as it should, when this is run. But we don't care about that change.
- The netCDF simulation output files (.nc files) are modified for some reason each time they are written out. It's probably a similar
  thing going on with some kind of timestamp being embedded in the file.
