.. SPHINX-START

``openlifu`` is a toolbox for planning and controlling focused
ultrasound treatments. It generally replicates the functionality
developed in the MATLAB `open-TFUS
toolbox <https://github.com/OpenwaterHealth/opw_neuromod_sw>`__.

Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.9 or later on Windows or Linux.

Create Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows:

.. code:: sh

   C:\Users\<uname>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe -m venv env
   .\env\Scripts\activate

Linux:

.. code:: sh

   python3.11 -m venv env

Install project (editable)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this repo as the working directory:

Basic mode
^^^^^^^^^^
.. code:: sh

   pip install -e .

Dev mode
^^^^^^^^
.. code:: sh

   pip install -e '.[dev]'

Installing Meshroom
-------------------

If you are using ``openlifu.photoscan`` to reconstruct meshes from photo collections, then you will need to set up **Meshroom**.

Ubuntu
~~~~~~

Download and Extract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Download Meshroom for Linux from `<https://alicevision.org/#meshroom>`_.
2. Extract the downloaded archive:

   .. code:: bash

      tar -xvf Meshroom-2023.3.0.tar.gz

Add Meshroom to PATH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Temporary (Current Session)**
Run:

.. code:: bash

   export PATH="<path-to-meshroom>/Meshroom-2023.3.0:$PATH"

Replace ``<path-to-meshroom>`` with the actual path where Meshroom was extracted.

**Permanent (Persistent Across Sessions)**
For Bash users:

.. code:: bash

   echo 'export PATH="<path-to-meshroom>/Meshroom-2023.3.0:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc

Windows
~~~~~~~

Download and Extract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download Meshroom for Windows from `<https://alicevision.org/#meshroom>`_.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.

Add Meshroom to PATH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Open **Edit environment variables for your account** from the Start menu.
2. In the **Environment Variables** window, under **User variables**, select **Path** and click **Edit**.
3. Click **New**, and add the path to the folder containing ``Meshroom.exe``.
4. Click **OK** to save the changes.

Enable GPU Acceleration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure Meshroom uses your NVIDIA GPU:

1. Open **NVIDIA Control Panel**.
2. In the left sidebar under **3D Settings**, click **Manage 3D settings**.
3. Go to the **Program Settings** tab.
4. Click **Add**, then browse to and select ``Meshroom.exe`` from the folder where you extracted Meshroom.
5. Under **Select the preferred graphics processor for this program**, choose **High-performance NVIDIA processor**.
6. Click **Apply**.

Version control of database using DVC (Data Version Control)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Data Version Control (DVC) is a data management tool that is meant to be run alongside Git.
In this project, DVC is used to link changes in the code to specific versions of a sample database containing example project files.
DVC can be used when this project is installed in Dev mode. You can read more about DVC and how to use it `here <https://dvc.org/doc/start>`_.
**Note:** Remote access to the sample database stored on google drive is currently restricted. Access requires a :code:`gdrive_client_secret`
for user access authentication to be shared by developers.

DVC usage
~~~~~~~~~

To download the sample database:

.. code:: sh

   git pull
   dvc remote modify --local shared_gdrive gdrive_client_secret <client_secret_here> # Contact developers for grive_client_secret
   dvc pull # Requires access to remote storage

This will download a directory 'db_dvc' in the repo directory that
contains the corresponding version of example database files.

To commit updates to the sample database:

.. code:: sh

   dvc add db_dvc
   git commit -m "Describe updates to database"
   git push
   dvc push #Requires access to remote storage
