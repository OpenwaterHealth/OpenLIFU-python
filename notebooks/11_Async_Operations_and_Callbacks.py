# # 11: Asynchronous Operations and Callbacks
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to use `LIFUInterface` in an asynchronous manner. This allows your program to monitor hardware connection status and receive data in the background without blocking the main execution thread. This is particularly useful for:
# *   Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that need to remain responsive.
# *   Long-running applications that perform other tasks while keeping an eye on hardware events.
# *   Reacting immediately to device connection or disconnection.
#
# We will use Python's `asyncio` library for the asynchronous parts and `threading` to run the asyncio event loop in the background, making it suitable for a Jupyter notebook environment.

# ## 1. Imports

# +
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
import logging
import threading
import time

from openlifu.io.LIFUInterface import LIFUInterface

# -

# ## 2. Logging and Global State
# For observing events from callbacks and managing the interface and thread.

# +
logger = logging.getLogger("AsyncDemo")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.handlers.clear()
ch = logging.StreamHandler()
ch.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(threadName)s - %(message)s'))
logger.addHandler(ch)
logger.propagate = False

# Global variables to hold the interface and monitoring thread
lifu_interface_async = None
monitor_thread_async = None
stop_monitor_event = threading.Event() # Used to signal the monitoring wrapper to stop
# -

# ## 3. Defining Callback Functions
#
# These functions will be called when specific events occur (e.g., device connected, data received).
# They will run in the thread context of the `LIFUInterface`'s internal event handling (often the thread running `start_monitoring`).

# +
def on_device_connected(descriptor: str, port: str):
    """Callback for when a device connects."""
    logger.info(f"üîå EVENT: Device CONNECTED! Descriptor: '{descriptor}', Port: '{port}'")

def on_device_disconnected(descriptor: str, port: str):
    """Callback for when a device disconnects."""
    logger.info(f"‚ùå EVENT: Device DISCONNECTED! Descriptor: '{descriptor}', Port: '{port}'")

def on_data_received(descriptor: str, packet_data: bytes | str): # Data type might vary
    """Callback for when data is received from a device."""
    # Note: For OpenLIFU, direct data packets might be less common than command-response.
    # This callback is more relevant if devices send unsolicited status updates or stream data.
    logger.info(f"üì¶ EVENT: Data RECEIVED from '{descriptor}': {packet_data}")

# ## 4. Initializing `LIFUInterface` and Binding Callbacks
#
# We initialize `LIFUInterface`. The `run_async` parameter in the constructor can set up internal async mechanisms if available, but the key is how `start_monitoring` is run.
#
# The callback signals are typically available on the `uart` attribute of the `hvcontroller` and `txdevice` objects.

# +

    # run_async=True might prepare internal async structures if supported by the interface directly.

# ## 8. Conclusion
#
# This notebook demonstrated the basics of setting up asynchronous monitoring with `LIFUInterface`.
# Key aspects:
# *   Defining callback functions for hardware events.
# *   Binding these callbacks to signals from the `txdevice` and `hvcontroller`.
# *   Running the `interface.start_monitoring()` asyncio function in a background thread.
# *   The main thread remains free for other tasks while events are handled by callbacks.
# *   Properly stopping the monitoring and cleaning up.
#
# This asynchronous pattern is fundamental for building responsive applications that need to interact with OpenLIFU hardware continuously or react to hardware-initiated events.
#
# **Next Steps:**
# *   The final planned notebook is `13_NIFTI_Integration_for_Targeting.py` (if `test_nifti.py` is suitable).
# *   Consider how this async pattern could be integrated into a larger application (e.g., a PyQt or Kivy GUI).
