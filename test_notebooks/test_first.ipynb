    "Once the environment has been set up, this notebook should be able to be run, cell-by-cell. One issue is that I've made modifications to k-wave-python (to cache and re-use gridweights, which saves a significant amount of time if you are running different simulations using the same array in the same position - it's being discussed in https://github.com/waltsims/k-wave-python/issues/342, but hasn't been merged yet, afaik). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have my modified version of k-wave-python, install it with `pip install -e .` from the `k-wave-python` directory. If you don't have my modified version, you can install the original version with `pip install k-wave-python`. If you are using the original version, be sure to set `USE_GRIDWEIGHTS` to `False` in order to prevent `open_pyfus` from trying to use a nonexistent interface for loading the gridweights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you are using the original version, import `openlifu` takes _way_ longer (45s on my PC), presumably hanging on `import kwave`. For some reason, it wants to re-download the binaries every time, even though they are already present in the the installation directory. I've opened an issue on this: https://github.com/waltsims/k-wave-python/issues/366."
